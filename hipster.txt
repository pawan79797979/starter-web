X-Pack is an Elastic Stack extension that bundles security, alerting, monitoring, reporting, and graph capabilities into one easy-to-install package. While the X-Pack components are designed to work together seamlessly, you can easily enable or disable the features you want to use.

Prior to Elasticsearch 5.0.0, you had to install separate Shield, Watcher, and Marvel plugins to get the features that are bundled together in X-Pack. With X-Pack, you no longer have to worry about whether or not you have the right version of each plugin, just install the X-Pack for the Elasticsearch version you’re running, and you’re good to go!
